Our dataset (in form of a csv file) was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews). The Kaggle dataset consists of 10 years worth of Amazon reviews of fine foods with a total of about 500,000 reviews. However, to make our dataset balanced - make sure we have the same number of star ratings in each dataset - we have cut down to 140,000 reviews with an 80% training, 10% development, and 10% testing split which each dataset having the same number of 1,2,3,4 and 5 star reviews. For each row in the dataset, there are 4 columns: the review id, the star rating of the review (ranging from 1-5), summary, and review body text.

1) **train_data.csv:** This file contains our training dataset with contains 112,000 Amazon product reviews.
