# Predicting-Star-Ratings-For-Amazon-Food-Reviews

Customer product reviews are, and will con- tinue to be, valuable currency for businessesâ€™ success and growth. 

Much research has been done to extract valuable insights from these reviews, such as customer sentiment analysis using multinomial Naive Bayes. 

This project explores and extends from such models by ex- ploring transformer models such as BERT and its variants, as well as RNN and CNN models, including GRU and LSTM, with the task of using Amazon product reviews to predict 1-5 star ratings.

Our results conclude that out of these models, RoBERTa has the highest test performance with a 68.4% accuracy, 0.683 F1 score and a 0.705 RMSE.
